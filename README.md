## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Mahek Patel, a computer science student at the University of South Florida. I'm passionate about creating smart, useful tech and exploring the intersection of software, AI/ML, and data. At Embarc Collective, I help streamline operations and membership processes by designing and implementing automation workflows. As a research assistant, Iâ€™ve worked on EdTech projects like a podcast generator and a course-focused chatbot to support student learning. Iâ€™m also part of the Break Through Tech AI program for 2025â€“2026, where Iâ€™m applying machine learning in real-world settings. I lead workshops, mentor others, and advocate for women in tech through roles like ACM Tech Lead and President of Women in Tech and Entrepreneurship at USF. I love learning, collaborating, and finding creative ways to make technology more impactful and accessible.
